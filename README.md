<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

<h2>Intial Setup</h2>
We were given an objective to create a Music-Themed Website showcasing our favorite music, genre, artists, or instruments. We had an assignment prior where we created a basic layout and how now moved on to creating more complex layouts. We are also asked to use CSS variables for colors, font sizes, margins, in addition to fluid typography, font integration, and responsiveness. We were given the initial design, to recreate the layout and given creative freedom.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot2]]

I first took the initial layout and planned my direction by sectioning and dividing the design. By drawing out boxes I'm able to visualize my semantic elements like header, footer, nav, section, and articles. Once I completed my initial setup, I moved on to setting up my folders, files, and code. With a basic webpage setup, it was time to add my variables, colors, and normalization to give myself a blank canvas and foundation.

<h2>Code and Layout</h2>
<p>Started with basic layout, by creating basic layout with a wrapper to control max-size of webpage. I took my navigation from past exercise and transfer over and apply it to this design</p>
<br />
<p>Started creating sections and debated on wether to use flex-box or grid for this featured artists section. I ended up trying both, and settled on sticking with grid to keep the number of rows and columns consistent for responsiveness. The new release initial design I was able to replicate but because i wanted consistency with my theme and design I decided to give them cards as well. These both sections took the longest as I played with both flex options and testing there responsiveness</p>

## Design
<p>With the creative freedom we were given my thought process was a Spotify with Apple UI design. I've wanted to recreate a textured, gradient blur. When it came to being responsive I also wanted to create a horizontal scroll, similar to different types of music players
